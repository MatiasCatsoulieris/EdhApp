# EdhApp
This is the first app i´ve been working on. It retrieves info of the trading card game Magic: the gathering from a remote API (Scryfall and Youtube).
You can create your own decks and add the requested cards in them. 
This app uses most of the technologies i´ve learned so far from the Android Jetpack;
Navigation component, MVVM, LiveData, Retrofit, RxJava, Glide, Ktx Extensions, DataBinding and ViewBinding, Room.
I´ve removed my YouTube Api Key, so in order to see the functionality of YouTube in the app, you will need one
